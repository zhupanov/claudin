# scripts/test-check-reviewers.sh — contract

Regression test for `check-reviewers.sh` probe acceptance logic. Tests the case-insensitive exact-match rule: after whitespace strip + lowercase, the probe reply must equal exactly `"ok"`.

## What it tests

Simulates the normalization pipeline (`tr -d '[:space:]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`) and verifies healthy/unhealthy classification for representative fixture replies. Does NOT launch real Codex/Cursor probes — tests only the string-matching logic.

## Fixture coverage

- **Positive** (should be healthy): `OK`, `ok`, `Ok`, `oK`, whitespace-padded, newline-terminated
- **Negative** (should be unhealthy): empty, `token`, `broken`, `NotOK`, `Sure OK`, `wok`, `okay`, `OK.`, auth errors, thinking-prefix responses

## Wiring

Target: `make test-harnesses`. Exit 0 on all-pass, exit 1 on any failure.
